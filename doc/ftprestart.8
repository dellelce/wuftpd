.SH Name
ftprestart \- restart previously shutdown ftp servers
.SH Syntax
.B ftprestart
[
.B \-V
]
.PP
The
.PN ftprestart
command
provides an automated way to restart previously shutdown ftp servers.
.PN ftprestart
is used when you are ready to re-enable your FTP server. It does the opposite of 
ftpshut and removes shutdown message files that were created by ftpshut. It will 
remove the system-wide shutdown message file as well as the shutdown message files 
in the anonymous ftp areas and any virtual ftp server areas. 
.PP
The
.B \-V
option causes the program to display copyright and version information, then
terminate.

.SH Sample Output
.PP
  ftprestart: /servers/some.domain/ftp/etc/shutmsg removed. 
  ftprestart: /servers/other.domain/ftp/etc/shutmsg removed. 
  ftprestart: /etc/shutmsg removed.
