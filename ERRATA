Known problems (2.6.2)
======================
These are problems which are known and will be corrected in future versions.



class=
------
The 'class=' phrase does not work as documented in the
upload.configuration.HOWTO.  This is because the way the ftpaccess file is
handled is far too simplistic for the feature.  This is most appearent on
the delete, rename, overwrite and chmod clauses.

To work arround this problem, you first need to know the default for these
clauses is 'no' for anonymous users and 'yes' for real and guest users.  To
override the default for a specific class, you can use the 'class=' phrase.
The problem occurs when you want to override the default for all but a
given class; in this case you'll need to explicitly list each class.



getcwd()
--------
A number of systems have no getcwd() function or their implementation of
the function is broken in some way.  A portable version of the getcwd()
function has been included in the support directory.  NeXTstep version 3
(nx3) and SunOS 4.1 (s41) are configured to use this portable version of
getcwd().  If your system is one of the following systems, and you get this
portable version to work, please report any change needed so we may include
them in a future release.  Remember, systems without a working getcwd()
have an identified security problem.

Systems needing getcwd():

  BSD 4.4       (bsd)
  Unix 3.x      (dec)
  DG/UX         (dgx)
  Dynix         (dyn)
  generic       (gen)
  NeXTstep 2.x  (nx2)
  OSF/1         (osf)
  Sony NewsOS   (sny)
