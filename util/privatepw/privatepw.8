.SH DESCRIPTION
If a site supports the SITE GROUP and SITE GPASS commands it is necessary
to be able to add, delete and list enhanced access group information. The
.I privatepw
utility is used to update this information in the group access 
(aka, ftpgroups) file. This is meant as an administrative tool
and not to be run by the general user population. This command 
requires read/write permission to the appropriate ftpgroups file.

.SH BACKGROUND

After user logs in, the SITE GROUP and SITE GPASS commands
may be used to specify an enhanced access group and associated
password. If the group name and password are valid, the user
becomes (via setegid()) a member of the group list in the group
access file (specified by the _PATH_PRIVATE define in pathnames.h).
.P
The format of the group access file is: 
.P
access_group_name:encrypted_password:real_group_name 
.P
where access_group_name is an arbitrary (alphanumeric +
punctuation) string. encrypted_password is the password encrypted
via crypt(3), exactly like in /etc/passwd. real_group_name is the
name of a valid group listed in /etc/group.
