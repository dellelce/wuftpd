# Makefile for SCO OpenServer 5
#
# When using gcc or egcs on OpenServer 5 change -belf to -melf in CFLAGS.

LIBES    = -lsupport -lsocket -lprot -lx -lm -lcurses -lcrypt
# To build on SCO Unix 3.2v4 remove -belf from CFLAGS and change LIBES:
# 1) If you do not have -lprot, use -lprot_s instead.
# 2) -lcrypt can be used in place of -lcrypt_i. If you do not have any crypt
#    library, get and install ftp.sco.com:/SLS/lng225* (International Crypt
#    Supplement), then use -lcrypt_i.
# 3) Never remove -lc; -lx should always be the last lib.
